# The Fun Programming Language

## Functional programming without the non-fun parts

Fun is a functional-ish programming language designed to be enjoyable, fulfilling and expressive.  Fun wishes to banish the evil that is I-know-what-I-want-to-do-but-the-damn-language-won't-let-me.    

A number of things make Fun special:

* Fun is declarative but supports a natural programming style 
* Fun is object-oriented with a rich inheritance model
* Fun has built in automated state management
