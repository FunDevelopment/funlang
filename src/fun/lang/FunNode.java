/**
 * The FunNode interface is implemented by all fun objects.  FunNodes are
 * either primitive or complex; a primitive node contains simple data or logic,
 * while a complex node contains other nodes.  FunNodes may also belong to one
 * of three mutually exclusive special categories: static, meaning they contain
 * unchanging data; dynamic, meaning they generate data; and definitions, meaning
 * they are employed by other nodes to generate runtime data.  Some nodes belong
 * to none of the three categories, meaning they neither contain nor generate data,
 * nor are referenced directly by nodes which do.
